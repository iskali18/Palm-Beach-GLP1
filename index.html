        GLP-1 medications such as semaglutide and tirzepatide are increasingly used in medically supervised
        weight-loss programs. This guide explains how these treatments work and helps you explore reputable
        providers across Palm Beach County.
      </p>

      <p class="body-lg">
        Clinics may offer structured programs including consultations, monitoring, and ongoing support.
        Understanding your options first can make comparing providers easier.

 <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>How GLP-1 treatments work</h2>

    <p class="body-lg">
      GLP-1 medications belong to a class called <strong>GLP-1 receptor agonists</strong>. In simple terms,
      these medicines mimic a natural hormone released by the gut after eating that helps regulate appetite
      and blood sugar levels. By reinforcing signals of fullness and reducing hunger, they can help lower
      overall calorie intake when combined with lifestyle changes.
    </p>

    <p class="body-lg">
      One effect of GLP-1 medicines is that they slow <strong>gastric emptying</strong>, meaning food moves
      more gradually from the stomach into the small intestine. This can increase feelings of fullness after
      meals, but it also explains why some people experience nausea or digestive discomfort—especially when
      first starting treatment or increasing doses.
    </p>

    <p class="body-lg">
      Some newer medications, such as tirzepatide, act on both GLP-1 and another hormone receptor called
      <strong>GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide)</strong>, a naturally occurring hormone
      involved in metabolic signaling. Because responses vary from person to person, treatment programs
      usually follow a gradual <strong>dose escalation (also called titration)</strong>, where the medication
      dose is increased step-by-step to improve tolerability while monitoring progress.
    </p>

    <p class="body-lg">
      Programs vary by clinic and may include consultations, follow-ups, nutrition guidance, and monitoring.
      Not every treatment is appropriate for every patient. A consultation with a licensed provider helps
      determine eligibility, expected outcomes, and how side effects should be managed.
    </p>

          <p class="service-desc">
            Semaglutide is a medication in the GLP-1 receptor agonist class. GLP-1 is a hormone your body releases
            after eating; medicines in this class mimic that signal. In medically supervised weight-loss care,
            semaglutide is typically used alongside nutrition and activity changes as part of a structured plan.
          </p>
          <p class="service-desc">
            Many people experience reduced hunger and earlier fullness. GLP-1 medicines can also slow stomach
            emptying, which is one reason nausea or “feeling very full” may occur—especially early in treatment
            or after a dose increase.
          </p>
          <p class="service-desc">
            In real-world clinic programs, “semaglutide” usually includes more than a prescription: an intake visit,
            stepwise dose escalation to improve tolerability, and follow-ups to review side effects, progress,
            and next steps.

          <p class="service-desc">
            Tirzepatide is different from semaglutide in a key way: it activates two hormone receptors (GIP and GLP-1).
            The FDA labeling describes tirzepatide as a “GIP receptor and GLP-1 receptor agonist.”
            In weight management programs, clinics may offer it as an option depending on a patient’s clinical picture,
            prior medication experience, or provider protocol.
          </p>
          <p class="service-desc">
            Like GLP-1 medicines, tirzepatide is associated with appetite regulation and can affect digestion.
            Many programs use a gradual dose-increase plan to improve tolerability, with follow-ups to review side effects,
            progress, and whether adjustments are needed.
          </p>
          <p class="service-desc">
            If you’re comparing clinics, a useful differentiator is how they supervise the process: how often you check in,
            what symptom guidance is provided, and how quickly dose increases are paused or modified when side effects occur.
          </p>

          <p class="service-desc">
            Medical weight loss is a broader category than GLP-1 medications alone. These are clinician-guided programs
            that may combine evaluation, nutrition counseling, activity planning, and behavior-change support. Some clinics
            include labs or other clinical measures depending on the patient and the program’s approach.
          </p>
          <p class="service-desc">
            If you’re early in the process, this category can be a strong starting point because it doesn’t assume a single
            medication path. Some programs focus on building a plan first and consider medications (including GLP-1 options)
            when it fits the clinical picture.
          </p>
          <p class="service-desc">
            When comparing clinics, look for clarity on what is included: intake, follow-ups, coaching, and any monitoring.
            Two “medical weight loss” programs can be very different in structure and support.

          <p class="service-desc">
            Concierge wellness is usually a service model rather than a single treatment. These providers often emphasize
            more personalized care plans, longer appointments, and easier access to the care team. The experience may feel
            higher-touch compared with standard office visits.
          </p>
          <p class="service-desc">
            Concierge practices may offer GLP-1 pathways and/or broader wellness services (for example, more frequent check-ins
            or expanded lifestyle support). Because offerings can vary widely, this category is most useful when clinics clearly
            state what’s included and what is billed separately.
          </p>
          <p class="service-desc">
            If you prefer structured guidance, ask how follow-ups work and what support is provided between visits. The level of
            access and the scope of services are often the main differentiators here.
